        <h2>WorkFlow</h2>
        <p>
         WorkFlow is a mobile application built with Swift
         and Firebase that connects homeowners with contractors for job fulfillment. 
         The app features secure authentication, user profiles for both homeowners and contractors, 
         real-time chat for seamless communication, and a bidding system that allows contractors to place and outbid job offers with live status updates. 
         Homeowners can post jobs, review contractor bids, and provide ratings upon completion, while contractors can showcase their skills and build credibility through reviews. 
         WorkFlow demonstrates full-stack mobile development, integrating a responsive iOS interface with a real-time cloud backend. This project was done with three other
         members of our software engineering class and it is currently not deployed.

        <h2>Willow and Weave - Salon Booking Website</h2>
        <p>
            Developed a production-ready booking platform using React and Supabase for a local salon. 
            The system streamlines appointment scheduling with real-time availability management and automated updates, 
            reducing manual coordination for both clients and staff.

        <h2>13-game (Tien Len)</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fully developed multiplayer card game based on the classic '13' rules,
            featuring a single-room system that supports up to 3 players, with real-time gameplay
            and room capacity handling. Below I have provided a small video showing the logic of the game at work using Spring Boot and 
            React for rendering the states of the game.

        <h2>Auction Platform - Capstone</h2>
        <p>
            This website, developed collaboratively by myself and three others, will serve as a general auction platform. Users will be able to post items, 
            view bids on their listings, and participate in live auctions with real-time livestreaming, replicating the experience of an in-person auction.
        </p>
        <p> This project will be done using React, Node.js and Express.js</p>
